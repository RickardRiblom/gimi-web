                            <p><strong>Ethical rules</strong></p>
<p><em>The ethical rules gives a reflection to our own valuations – to protect the children, their development and give them a great knowledge about digital money.</em></p>
<p>At Gimi we are working in a way that gives children the opportunity to learn in a comfortable and pedagogical tempo how to handle their own money and prepare themselves for the life as a grown-up. Below you can take part of our ethical rules that shows how we relate to children and members of their family that are users at Gimi.</p>
<p>We want to make clear that our work goes beyond the boundries of Gimi. We dosen’t only want our children to feel safe using our app, but also when they are purchasing items from the Internet or ”internetsurf” in general. We have a continous work where we try to influence other companies to follow the ethic rules that we at Gimi has developed.</p>
<p>Our ethical rules has been developed with help from educators, psychologists, economists, children and parents. The rules relates to global rules and international laws, and they are customized to the digital world where many youths has access. The rules has been created to show how we at Gimi handles information and behavior among our young users. We think and hope that other operators, who are reaching out to children and youths, will follow our ethical rules so that the childrens development and interests will always come first.</p>
<p>Areas that we have put focus to when we have worked with our ethical rules are;</p>
<p>Marketing towards children, Collection of information regarding the children, production and developing services and goods for children, decision environment for children and youths, justification of wrong decisions, support and communication for the whole family.</p>
<p>Why we have developed our ethical rules?</p>
<p>Children are today using the Internet more and more and by only 3 years most children are online. Early, children are exposed to messages and information from companies. They have to make decisions when it comes to purchases and make other different choices. That children is exposed to advertisements and commercials pointed towards them is a reality that we have to accept. We find it extremely important, with this kind of exposed market, that behavior, marketing and ethical rules is adjusted the children. It is the children that should be able to use the Internet, not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>Our ethical rules</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purchases should be adjusted to the children</strong></p>
<p>We think that the purchase offers should be adapted to the children. Today, the children are more exposed to information and offers through the internet.  It’s difficult to see a clear line between what is incitements and what is just sharing information. It’s important that apps and companies gets aware of how they reach out to children. If their approach and purpose is to trick the children into purchasing items, the children are not going to be able to get the right knowledge about handling their own money.</p>
<p><strong>Education and lessons learned will be at focus</strong></p>
<p>Our vision is that society should help educating children about economy in a fun and pedagogical way. The purpose with lessons learned is to make sure that the children will be able to think for themselves, hit their own solutions in a safe environment and create more innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Decisions are supposed to prepare the children for the grown-up life</strong></p>
<p>It’s important that the children learns how to take responsibility . By putting children in a safe and comfortable zone, you will not challenge them and maybe even stop their ability to get a fast curve of learning. Children is supposed to be able to take different kind of choices, right and wrong, so that they after a while can eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to economy and purchases. We will create a method for children so that they can implement their choices and let the parents adjust the responsibility after how mature behavior the children shows.</p>
<p><strong>The children will owe their own money</strong></p>
<p>In a pedagogical way, we would like to give the children a greater understanding for money by giving them responsibility for their own money. It’s important that children can decide what they would do with the money. Making wrong decisions when it comes to economical actions will make the children take better decisions next time when it is a similar purchase.</p>
<p><strong>The child should be able to make a dections in his own tempo</strong></p>
<p>Children should be able to decide over their own economy without any influence from commercials, misleading messages or the ”must-have” society.</p>
<p><strong>Stop – think – buy is a good method</strong></p>
<p>It is only positive that the children gets space to reflect over their decisions before they buys something. There should be time for reflections and collecting information connected to the purchase, adjusted to the size of the purchase. A fine example for enough time for reflection is where the seller pauses the purchasing process and encourage you to press an additional button to finalize your purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity &amp; Overview</strong></p>
<p>It should be easy to see when a purchase has been completed and what any extra costs you can expect. Many children buys stuff from the internet these days, without the knowledge that there is a cost connected with the decision. Generating clarity to create an understanding for decision making and even the consequence from purchases is our ”perfect picture” how a purchasing process for children should be.</p>
<p><strong>Accentuate economical conversations within the family</strong></p>
<p>The economical conversations between children and parents at home is important. A good time to discuss around the economical topic is when the family is gathered. By doing that you give the children the opportunity to take part of the day to day economy at home. Parents should talk about money, not only where there is no more money left, but also as something exciting. In the end that will lead to a positive setting.</p>
<p><strong>How we handle information and data</strong></p>
<p>Childrens information is sensitive. That is why we have adjust our handling of information in a way that protects the information and at the same time creates a safe environment to handle money.</p>
<p><strong>Handling data</strong></p>
<p>We gather information from our users so that we can learn more about children and parents behavior. That information gives us the opportunity to develop and make our service better for the users. We collect all of our information safely, and we will never use the information for marketing offers or other incentives directed towards children.</p>
<p><strong>Handling pictures</strong></p>
<p>Uploaded pictures from users will not be used by Gimi for external use.  The pictures has only one purpose. To improve the users experience.</p>
<p><strong>Personal information</strong></p>
<p>The childs phone number, name and other personal information will be placed in our database. We will never take any part in this information, except from some circumstances when we will try to help users that needs to resetting or upgrade their account.</p>
<p><strong>A safe platform for communication</strong></p>
<p>We do not take any part when it comes to communication between users. Communication is suppose to improve the user experience and improve the communication at home when it comes to money.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing aimed at children</strong></p>
<p>Gimi will never do marketing aimed at children without any permission from the parents. The marketing will never take advantage from the childrens good beliefs and not contain any direct purchase solicitations.</p>
<p><strong>We are not using in-app purchases for children</strong></p>
<p>At Gimi the children are not able to implement in app-purchases, and can therefore not be encouraged to upgrade their service in change for money.</p>
<p><strong>Our ethical rules follows</strong></p>
