# gimi-web

## Specifications
Alright Gimi-web will be a Single page Application that will host the content for the sites:

* veckopengen.se
* gimitheapp.com
* ukepengen.no

The content is stored in the folders /veckopengen.se, /ukepengen.no, /gimitheapp.com.
This is rough description of how i would have done it and the milestones this project has. The milestones will be tied to a monetary reward. The last milestone is arbitrary feedback. We will only do this one iteration to not impose great risk on the project. Code reviews and feedback for every commit is calculated into the individual milestones.

The end result should be a Single Page Application (SPA) written in react powering these three sites. Some content in the SPA will be site specific (i.e veckopengen.se, ukepengen.no and gimitheapp.com specific). More information on this in the trello cards.

Trello cards is at this url: https://trello.com/b/YfuphV6N/gimi-web

Here are the MileStones:

* fork veckopengen.se folder in src directory
* Support for different languages (i18n) on different sites. Make i18n support for every text on the whole site using your favourite react i18n component (end result should be a sv.json, en.json and no.json) in the src/i18n folder)
* make routing support for different content on different sites (i.e solve all the trello cards in https://trello.com/b/YfuphV6N/gimi-web)
* Make support for blog (see this card: https://trello.com/c/WkZrVbf5/4-localize-every-text-except-this-site-see-screenshot)
* test and quality assure (HOME) (se,no,en site)

Budget: 1500 dollars

Final feedback is 200 dollars, the reset of the milestones is 1300/number of milestones each
